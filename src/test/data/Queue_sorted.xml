<!--
QueueEntry elements The entries are ordered in the sequence they have been or
will be executed, beginning with the running entries, followed by the waiting
entries, highest QueueEntry/@Priority first, which are then followed by the
completed entries, sorted beginning with the youngest QueueEntry/
@EndTime. The Queue will display a list of all QueueEntries that are still
accessible on the device using the queue entry handling messages.
A QueueEntry is not automatically deleted when executed or aborted, but rather
it remains in the Queue and its status is changed to Completed or Aborted
accordingly. QueueEntrys with Status = Completed or Status =
Aborted must not count towards determining Queue/@Status based on
the number of QueueEntrys versus the QueueSize.
